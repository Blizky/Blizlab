# Blizlab
Offline web-apps for content creators — fast, private, and easy to use.

Blizlab is a collection of small, focused browser tools designed to help creators move faster.  
Every app runs entirely **locally** in your browser — no uploads, no logins, no tracking, no dependencies.  
Just open the tool and work.

Blizlab’s goal is to provide simple, reliable utilities for video production, graphic design, and digital workflows, all without installing anything or sharing any files online.

## Available Tools

### Retroit
Vintage-style photo editor for creators.

## Philosophy
Blizlab apps follow three principles:

1. **Local-first**  
   All image processing happens inside the browser. No servers involved.

2. **Zero friction**  
   Tools load instantly with simple controls and no setup.

3. **Creator-focused**  
   Each app solves a practical need in a content creator workflow — quickly and without overcomplication.

## How to Use
Each tool lives in its own folder inside this repository and can be accessed directly through its URL.  
Because everything is static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, any tool can be downloaded and opened locally without installation.

---

## Development
All apps are:

- Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- Fully client-side  
- Safe to fork, modify, and host anywhere  
- Designed to work offline after one load (browser caching)

Pull requests, ideas, and bug reports are welcome.
